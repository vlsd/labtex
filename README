To install locally on *nix systems, including OS X:

$ mkdir -p ~/.texmf/tex/latex/labtex
$ cp *.sty ~/.texmk/tex/latex/labtex/

Add the labtex.sty file in this new folder and, in your .tex document, add

\usepackage{labtex}

after you include all other packages. I *think* the dependencies are only
amsmath.sty and amsfonts.sty. Can someone please check?
