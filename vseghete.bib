It is shown that, even if all the subsystems governing the continuous dynamics, in the absence of impulses, are not {ISS/iISS}, impulses can successfully stabilize the system in the {ISS/iISS} sense, provided that there are no overly long intervals between impulses, i.e., the impulsive and switching signal satisfies a dwell-time upper bound condition. Moreover, these impulsive {ISS/iISS} stabilization results can be applied to systems with arbitrarily large time-delays. Conversely, in the case when all the subsystems governing the continuous dynamics are {ISS/iISS} in the absence of impulses, the {ISS/iISS} properties can be retained if the impulses and switching do not occur too frequently, i.e., the impulsive and switching signal satisfies a dwell-time lower bound condition. Several illustrative examples are presented, with their numerical simulations, to demonstrate the main results.},

It is shown that if a nonlinear impulsive time-delay system without impulse input delays is exponentially stable, then under some conditions, its stability is robust with respect to small impulse input delays. Moreover, it is also shown that for a stable nonlinear impulsive time-delay system, if the magnitude of the delayed impulses is sufficiently small, then under some conditions, the delayed impulses do not destroy the stability irrespective of the sizes of the impulse input delays. The efficiency of the proposed results is illustrated by three numerical examples.},

The passivity in this context stands for the ability of the robot to walk autonomously down an inclined surface without any external source of energy. Previous research efforts in passive walking were limited to four link models with knees or 2-link models without knees with a variety of mass distributions. In this paper we analyze the dynamics of a five-link robot with knees and upper body. We were successful in detecting three limit cycles that include three distinct upper body motions. We have investigated the structural stability of these cycles subject to variations in the upper body length. The results demonstrated that the stability can be improved with addition of linear dampers in the hip joints of the model. Also, our investigation demonstrated that erect body posture is only achievable when torsional springs are placed in the hip joints.},

Impact of the lower limbs with the walking surface and its effect on the walking dynamics was considered first. The key issue of multiple impacts is reviewed in detail. Next, we consider the dynamic stability of bipedal gait. We review the use of discrete maps in studying the stability of the closed orbits that represent the dynamics of a biped, which can be characterized as a hybrid system.

Given a model of the system and a bounded set of possible initial states, the algorithm employs an {LMI} approach to compute both upper and lower bounds on reachable regions. Rather than performing computations in the state-space, this method uses impact maps to find the reachable sets on the switching surfaces of the system. This tool can then be used to deduce safety and performance results about the system.},

The theory of Lagrangian mechanics is extended to capture a variety of nonsmooth collision behaviors in rigid body systems. Notably, a variational impact model is presented for the transition of constraints behavior that describes a biped switching stance feet at the conclusion of a step.

Next, discretizations of the impact mechanics are developed using the framework of variational discrete mechanics. The resulting variational collision integrators are consistent with the continuous time theory and have an underlying symplectic structure.

In addition to their role as integrators, the discrete equations of motion capturing nonsmooth dynamics enable a direct method for trajectory optimization. Upon specifically defining the optimal control problem for nonsmooth systems, examples demonstrate this optimization method in the task of determining periodic gaits for
two rigid body biped models.

An additional effort is made to optimize bipedal walking motions through modifications in system design. A method for determining optimal designs using a combination
of trajectory optimization methods and surrogate function optimization methods is defined. This method is demonstrated in the task of determining knee joint placement
in a given biped model.},

The main challenge with this problem is that the data are available only as a mixture of observations generated by a finite set of different interacting linear subsystems so that one does not know a priori which subsystem has generated which data. To overcome this difficulty, we present here a sparse optimization approach inspired by very recent developments from the community of compressed sensing. We formally pose the problem of identifying each submodel as a combinatorial â„“ 0 optimization problem. This is indeed an {NP-hard} problem which can interestingly, as shown by the recent literature, be relaxed into a (convex) â„“ 1 -norm minimization problem. We present sufficient conditions for this relaxation to be exact. The whole identification procedure allows us to extract the parameter vectors (associated with the different subsystems) one after another without any prior clustering of the data according to their respective generating-submodels. Some simulation results are included to support the potentialities of the proposed method.},

As a natural consequence of treating general systems of this class in terms of the order and the number of subsystems, only sufficient conditions are worked out. They depend on the complete separation of the stabilizing and anti-stabilizing solutions of the algebraic Riccati equation associated to each subsystem. Moreover, as positive features, it is shown that the dwell time preserving the specification can be calculated through linear matrix inequalities {(LMIs)} and line search, being thus numerically solvable in polynomial time, and this allows the treatment of stable switched linear systems which do not admit a common Lyapunov function. The case of a guaranteed {RMS} gain for arbitrary switching signals is also addressed. A simple academic example constituted by three subsystems of third order is included for illustration.},

	abstract = {A system of rigid bodies with multiple simultaneous unilateral contacts is considered in this paper. The problem is to predict the velocities of the bodies and the frictional forces acting on the simultaneous multicontacts. This paper presents a numerical method based on an extension of an explicit time-stepping scheme and an application of the differential inclusion process introduced by J. J. Moreau. From a differential kinematic analysis of contacts, we derive a set of transfer equations in the velocity-based time-stepping formulation. In applying the {Gauss-Seidel} iterative scheme, the transfer equations are combined with the Signorini conditions and Coulomb's friction law. The contact forces are properly resolved in each iteration, without resorting to any linearization of the friction cone. The proposed numerical method is illustrated with examples, and its performance is compared with an acceleration-based scheme using linear complementary techniques. Multibody contact systems are broadly involved in many engineering applications. The motivation of this is to solve for the contact forces and body motion for planning the fixture-inserting operation. However, the results of the paper can be generally used in problems involving multibody contacts, such as robotic manipulation, mobile robots, computer graphics and simulation, etc. The paper presents a numerical method based on an extension of an explicit time-stepping scheme, and an application of the differential inclusion process introduced by J. J. Moreau, and compares the numerical results with an acceleration-based scheme with linear complementary techniques. We first describe the mathematical model of contact kinematics of smooth rigid bodies. Then, we present the {Gauss-Seidel} iterative method for resolving the multiple simultaneous contacts within the time-stepping framework. Finally, numerical examples are given and compared with the previous results of a different approach, which shows that the simulation results of these two methods agree well, and it is also generally more efficient, as it is an explicit method. This paper focuses on the description of the proposed time-stepping and {Gauss-Seidel} iterations and their numerical implementation, and several theoretical issues are yet to be resolved,- like the convergence and uniqueness of the {Gauss-Seidel} iteration, and the existence and uniqueness of a positive k in solving frictional forces. However, our limited numerical experience has indicated positive answers to these questions. We have always found a single positive root of k and a convergent solution in the {Gauss-Seidel} iteration for all of our examples.},

{"An} alternative approach is to use an iterative process to find a solution for the contact dynamics defined by the transfer (18), the Signorini conditions (19), and Coulomb’s law (20) or (21). One such approach is to use the {Gauss–Seidel} iteration method first suggested by Moreau [4], [15], who has developed a sound mathematical justification based on the theory of convex anal- ysis and differential inclusion.
The {Gauss–Seidel} iteration is essentially a method of prop- agation of contact among the multiple, simultaneous contacts. At any step of the iteration, only one contact is updated, and all other contacts are assumed to have been resolved previously. Starting from an initial guess of all of the contact forces in the transfer (18), one can choose to update the contact forces of any single contact, for example,    . Therefore, the only un- knowns in the transfer (18) are the contact force    and the contact velocity    of this contact, while    in the equations is already given. Thus, this transfer equation is then resolved by applying the contact laws for determining    , to be discussed next."}

They describe a general methodology which extends the construction of navigation functions on sphere worlds to any smoothly deformable space. According to this methodology, the problem of constructing a navigation function is reduced to the construction of a transformation mapping a given space into its model sphere world. The transformation must satisfy certain regularity conditions guaranteeing invariance of the navigation function properties. The authors demonstrate this idea by constructing navigation functions on star worlds: n-dimensional star shaped subsets of En punctured by any finite number of smaller disjoint n-dimensional stars. This construction yields automatically a bounded torque feedback control law which is guaranteed to guide the robot to destination point from almost every initial position without hitting any obstacle},

The skidding causes the vehicle to behave discontinuously during a maneuver as well as introduces complications to the observation of the vehicleâ€™s state, both of which affect a controllerâ€™s performance. This paper addresses estimation of contact state by applying switched system optimization to estimate skidding properties of the skid-steered vehicle.

In order to treat the skid-steered vehicle as a switched system, the vehicleâ€™s ground interaction is modeled using Coulomb friction, thereby partitioning the system dynamics into four distinct modes, one for each combination of the forward and back wheel pairs sticking or skidding. Thus, as the vehicle maneuvers, the system propagates over some mode sequence, transitioning between modes over some set of switching times. This paper presents second-order optimization algorithms for estimating these switching times. We emphasize the importance of the second-order algorithm because it exhibits quadratic convergence and because even for relatively simple examples, first-order methods fail to converge on time scales compatible with real-time operation. Furthermore, the paper presents a technique for estimating the mode sequence by optimizing a relaxation of the switched system.},

The sufficient condition turns out to be more efficient from the computational point of view. Some examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

As an example, a model is derived for a single arm moving in a plane. A model for a three-dimensional marionettes is also shown. Finally, an expansive-space tree {(EST)} motion planner is used to find a path from an input configuration to a goal for a puppet arm with seven degrees of freedom},

One can also choose to include friction between each body and the plane of motion. To support optimal and robust part design, {dVC} also allows on-the-fly changes to parameters of the geometric and physical models.

	abstract = {This paper introduces appropriate concepts of input-to-state stability {(ISS)} and {integral-ISS} for impulsive systems, i.e.,Â dynamical systems that evolve according to ordinary differential equations most of the time, but occasionally exhibit discontinuities (or impulses). We provide a set of Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions for establishing these {ISS} properties. When the continuous dynamics are {ISS}, but the discrete dynamics that govern the impulses are not, the impulses should not occur too frequently, which is formalized in terms of an average dwell-time {(ADT)} condition. Conversely, when the impulse dynamics are {ISS}, but the continuous dynamics are not, there must not be overly long intervals between impulses, which is formalized in terms of a novel reverse {ADT} condition. We also investigate the cases where (i) both the continuous and discrete dynamics are {ISS}, and (ii) one of these is {ISS} and the other only marginally stable for the zero input, while sharing a common Lyapunov function. In the former case, we obtain a stronger notion of {ISS}, for which a necessary and sufficient Lyapunov characterization is available. The use of the tools developed herein is illustrated through examples from a {Micro-Electro-Mechanical} System {(MEMS)} oscillator and a problem of remote estimation over a communication network.},

Two different methods are used to take into account the inequality constraints in the computation of the stationary value of the action integral: the Valentine variables method and the penalty functions method. The equations of motion resulting from the application of the Valentine variables method, which introduces the concept of “nonsmooth” impacts, constitute the exact model of the constrained mechanical system; such a model is suitable to be employed when the impacting parts of the actual mechanical system are very stiff. The equations of motion resulting from the application of the penalty functions method, which introduces the concept of “smooth impacts,” constitute an approximate model of the constrained mechanical system; such a model is suitable to be employed when the impacting parts of the actual mechanical system show some flexibility. Various feedback control laws from the natural outputs and from their time derivatives are studied with reference to both models of impact; the closed-loop systems resulting from the application of the same control law to both models show pretty much the same global asymptotic stability properties. The proposed control laws are only concerned with regulation problems in the presence of possible contacts and impacts among parts of the mechanical system or with the external environment.

Two solution procedures that cast the impact equations in differential and algebraic forms are developed to solve the general problem. The differential formulation can be used to obtain three sets of solutions based on the kinematic, kinetic, and energetic definitions of the coefficient of restitution, whereas the algebraic formulation can be used to obtain solu tions based on the approaches presented in Whittaker (1904) and Brach (1991). A specific example of a planar three-link chain with two contact points is studied to compare the out comes predicted by each approach. A particular emphasis is placed on the energy loss that results from the application of each solution scheme. The circumstances in which various methods lead to identical or distinct outcomes are investigated. Most importantly, the study elaborates on the rebounds at the noncolliding ends, a phenomenon that is observed only in multicontact collisions. The interaction of the chain with the contact surfaces at the noncolliding contact points is examined, and the differences in the prediction of rebounds that arise from using various methods are investigated.},

The periodic orbits on different slopes are produced from an original periodic orbit, which is either a natural passive limit cycle on a specific slope or a stable periodic walking gait on level ground generated with active control. First, inspired by the controlled symmetries approach, a general result on gait generation on different slopes based on a periodic orbit on a specific slope is obtained. Second, the time-scaling control approach is integrated to reproduce geometrically same periodic orbits for biped robots with one degree of underactuation. The degree of underactuation is compensated by one degree-of-freedom in the temporal evolution that scales the original periodic orbit. Necessary and sufficient conditions are investigated for the existence and stability properties of periodic orbits on different slopes with the proposed control law. Finally, the proposed approach is illustrated by two kinds of underactuated biped robots: one has a passive gait on a specific ground slope and the other does not have a natural passive gait.},

The resulting algorithms (for both first and second derivatives) each require only a single integration along the time horizon, yielding excellent computational performance. We present an example that uses this method to do local motion planning for a parallel parking maneuver for a kinematic car using the infinitesimal Lie bracket expansion that is used to demonstrate controllability.

	abstract = {Dynamical systems that are described by an interaction between continuous and discrete dynamics are called hybrid systems. Their evolution is generally given by equations of motion containing mixtures of logic, discrete-valued or digital dynamics, and continuous-variable or analog dynamics. A switched system is a hybrid dynamical system consisting of a family of continuous-time subsystems and a rule that orchestrates the switching between them. These systems have numerous applications in control of mechanical systems, automotive industry, aircraft and air traffic control, switching power converters, and many others. This thesis will focus on the problem of asymptotic trajectory tracking for switched systems. First, the tracking control problem is properly stated and solved for a controlled elliptical billiard system. In order to find an admissible class of reference trajectories inside the billiards a motion planning problem has been solved by using results from the theory of non-negative polynomials and {LMIs} techniques. The trajectory tracking problem in presence of uncertainties on the plant parameters has been also considered and solved in both cases of state-feedback and output-feedback. In the second part, the results obtained for the billiard system are generalized for a class of switched systems having linear dynamics in each operating mode, linear reset maps and possible nonuniform state space among the different modes. In all cases the proposed control strategy is based on a dynamic compensator, whose state is subject to discontinuities and whose structure is based on a nonsmooth version of the internal model principle.},

An extensive suite of experimental results documents the robot’s significant “intrinsic mobility”—the traversal of rugged, broken, and obstacle-ridden ground without any terrain sensing or actively controlled adaptation. {RHex} achieves fast and robust forward locomotion traveling at speeds up to one body length per second and traversing height variations well exceeding its body clearance.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional compass biped is modelled as a spherical kinematic pair in which the rigid legs are combined at the hip by a spherical joint giving rise to constraints. The contact between a foot and the ground is modelled as a perfectly plastic impact, constraining the foot to stay fixed on the ground during the other leg's swing phase. This con- tact condition is represented by another spherical joint connection between the foot and the point of contact on the ground. During each swing phase, a variational integrator in combination with the discrete null space method for the treatment of the constraints yields the reduced forced discrete equations of motion. The contact is transferred in- stantaneously when the second foot hits the ground and the first one is released. Then, {DMOCC} (discrete mechanics and optimal control for constrained systems) is applied to determine actuating torques in the hip joint during half a gait cycle.
In the {DMOCC} approach, the discrete equations of motion are formulated in terms of the discrete states and controls. Together with periodic boundary conditions on the con- figuration and conjugate momentum, the reduced equations serve as nonlinear equality constraints for the minimisation of a specific cost functional. The algorithm yields a se- quence of discrete configurations together with a sequence of actuating torques in the hip, guiding this underactuated system.},

We concentrate on the well-known Painlevé example the dynamics of which in a sliding regime may be singular, depending on the friction coefficient. A new critical friction coefficient is presented below, the contact forces of which remain bounded. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the vector field near the singularity shows that the eventual divergence of the contact forces does not call into question the well-posedness of the model.},

	abstract = {Traditional methods for simulating rigid body dynamics involves determining the current contact arrangement (e.g., each contact is either a "rolling" or "sliding" contact). The development of this approach is most clearly seen in the work of Haug et al. {[Mech.} Machine Theory 21 (1986) 401-425] and Pfeiffer and Glocker {[Multibody} Dynamics with Unilateral Contacts {(Wiley}, 1996)]. However, there has been a controversy about the status of rigid body dynamics as a theory, due to simple problems in the area which do not appear to have solutions; the most famous, if not the earliest is due to Paul Painlevé {[C.R.} Acad. Sci. Paris 121 (1895) 112-115]. Recently, a number of time-stepping methods have been developed to overcome these difficulties. These time-stepping methods use integrals of the forces over time-steps, rather than the actual forces. This allows impulsive forces without the need for a separate formulation, or special procedures, to cover this case. The newest of these methods are developed in terms of complementarity problems. The complementarity problems that define the time-stepping procedure are solvable unlike previous methods for simulating rigid body dynamics with friction. Proof of the existence of solutions to the continuous problem can be shown in the sense of measure differential inclusions in terms of these methods. In this paper, a number of these variants will be discussed, and their essential properties proven.},

Using this representation, we derive a simple algorithm to numerically calculate forward kinematic maps, body velocities, and their derivatives. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scales to large systems very well by using recursion to take advantage of the tree structure. Moreover, this method is less prone to modeling errors because each element of the graph is simple. The tree representation provides a natural framework to simulate mechanical dynamics with numeric computations rather than large symbolically-derived equations. In particular, the representation allows one to simulate systems in generalized coordinates using Lagrangian dynamics without symbolically finding the equations of motion. This method also applies to the relatively new variational integrators which numerically integrate dynamics in a way that preserve momentum and other symmetries. We show how to implement both integration schemes for an arbitrary system of interconnected rigid bodies in a computationally efficient way while avoiding symbolic equations of motion. We end with an example simulating a marionette; a mechanically complex, high degree-of-freedom system.},
